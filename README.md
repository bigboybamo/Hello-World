# Hello-World

Bamiji here!

I'm relatively new at coding so bear with me

I'm learning about javascript and hope to branch into react.js when i' done with that.
So far enjoying my coding journey.
The #100daysof code challenge on twitter was one of the factors that pushed me to pick up programming again, i hope to complete this challenge even though my current job makes it difficult for me to code everyday(fingers crossed).
